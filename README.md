Â ðŸ”¥TASK: Create a simple calculator using enums and pattern matching
Task Details
In this task, students will create a simple calculator in Rust that can perform basic arithmetic operations using enums and pattern matching.

### Checklist
* Define the Operation enum with the appropriate variants and values.
* Write the calculate function signature.
* Implement the calculate function using pattern matching to perform the appropriate arithmetic operation.
* Prompt the user to input the first number, operation, and second number.
* Parse the user input into appropriate variables.
* Create an Operation enum instance with the parsed input values.
* Call the calculate function with the created Operation enum instance.
* Print the result to the console.
* Compile and run the program to test its functionality.
